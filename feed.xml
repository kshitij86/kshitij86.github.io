                <p>Recently I challenged myself to build an app from scratch that could help my track my trade ideas - in just <em><strong>three hours</strong></em>.</p>
<div class="post__toc">
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

</ul>
</div>
<p>Here is the main idea I had with this app - </p>
<p>1. The app should be responsive, so I used <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/">material-ui</a> - so I could jot down ideas easily using my phone</p>
<p>2. I used <a href="https://supabase.com/">supabase</a> with the app - so I wouldn't have to setup the database/backend and host it</p>
<p>3. I hosted the app on netlify free tier - so deployment and builds become as easy as pushing to Github</p>
<p>These are the main features I had in mind for this app - </p>
<p>1. A multi-tab mobile app like UI for quickly switching between screens</p>
<p>2. Adding trades in the app and store them in a database</p>
<p>3. Some custom utility like adding new instruments on the fly</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ikafs7r5p">Setting up the backend with supabase</h2>
<p>Setting up the database with supabase is as simple as creating a table using the built-in UI editor.</p>

<p>Skipping the obvious setting up of the tables - the most striking feature of supabase database is the RLS or Row Level Security that can be used to control individual rows using policies. After a few Google searches, it became clear that I needed to setup policies to allow access to my React app to read/write to a table. </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ikag4ah814">Creating the React.js application</h2>
<p>For the application, I used a bottom navigation based layout, that used different components, as shown below - </p>
<div class="gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--full"><div class="gallery"  data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2">
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://kshitij86.github.io/media/posts/1/gallery/Screenshot-2025-02-17-at-11.15.05-PM.png" data-size="2558x1434"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kshitij86.github.io/media/posts/1/gallery/Screenshot-2025-02-17-at-11.15.05-PM-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="404"></a></figure>
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://kshitij86.github.io/media/posts/1/gallery/Screenshot-2025-02-17-at-11.12.18-PM.png" data-size="2558x1434"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kshitij86.github.io/media/posts/1/gallery/Screenshot-2025-02-17-at-11.12.18-PM-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="404"></a></figure>

<p>It allows the user to select the instrument, a strategy name and describe the strategy in detail. The settings view has some basic options to add new instruments, delete test trades (useful when testing the app) and other features I plan to add to make this app really useful - like filtering trades based on the instrument name etc.</p>
<p>Connecting the app to supabase was really simple - just add your connection string and the key. Then create a supabase client and basic CRUD works really well. It is possibly the simplest integration with a database+backend.</p>
<p>Material UI components handled the rest - responsive components that can be used on the mobile easily without any additional setup.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ikagn63b1i">To finish it up</h2>
<p>To deploy it I just had to push it to Github and that's it - netlify builds it automatically as new commits are pushed to the app. And I get my very own app hosted in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Building this app from scratch was to really just test my skills in frontend. Three hours may sound like a lot for an app so simple - but being out of touch with React.js for too long, it was probably more challenging for me than a seasoned UI developer. Still I had fun building it. I also plan to flesh out the features and add new ones - make it really useful for anyone who wants to quickly note down their trade ideas.</p>
<p>Watch this space for more projects - I plan to explore complex topics in quant trading, AI, security and more soon.</p>
